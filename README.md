Python Loops Practice
This repository contains my practice work while learning about loops in Python. It includes various examples from basic iteration to more complex scenarios involving data structures like lists and dictionaries.

Concepts Covered
Using for loops with range() to repeat an action a specific number of times.
Iterating over elements in a list.
Using enumerate() to get both the index and value of list items.
Using zip() to iterate over multiple lists in parallel.
Using while loops that run as long as a condition is met.
Looping through a list of dictionaries and using another dictionary for lookups.
